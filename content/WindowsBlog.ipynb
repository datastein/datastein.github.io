    "# <span style=\"color:#E56717\"> Building a Data Science Blog on the Window's platform using Anaconda, Pelican, and Github </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many great reasons that a Data Science blog might be conducive to your career. The first reason is that it allows potential employers or collaborators a chance to see that you possess a strong aptitude for unique problem solving that often canâ€™t be achieved during a relatively short interview. It also allows one to see whether you possess an ability to clearly articulate your data interpretation and statistical methods effectively.  In a world where your statistics can be on-point and you can use the best methods and yet still have the wrong answer, it is important that you clearly lay out your hypotheses and assumptions to your readers and reviewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, we need a means of getting said blog up-and-running.  When I started this blog, I wanted the fastest way to create beautiful content with a minimum of trouble. I also wanted an easy way to demonstrate what my code looks like to an outside reader. Thus, I turned to the use of a static site generator.  While there are few different generators that I could have used, I have been spending a lot of time on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) recently. Therefore, I have chosen to use [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/) which is written in Python. This is a great tool that makes if very easy to generate a beautiful looking blog.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While there are several really great blogs out there that cover how to generate a static website on Pelican, there are relatively few that cover building a static website in the Windows environment with Anaconda Python distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## <span style=\"color: #E56717\"> Requirements</span>\n",
    "----------------------------------------------\n",
    "There are several minimum requirements to getting your blog running. This section will run through how to install each components. The bare minimum requirements are: \n",
    " 1. Install Python 2.7.x, Python 3, or Python 3.5 from [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n",
    " 2. Set up a virtual environment\n",
    " 3. Install Pelican Package\n",
    "\n",
    "### <span style=\"color:#786D5F\"> 1. Install Python </span>\n",
    " Assuming you are starting at square one, you might first need to install Python. I recommend using <mark><span style = \"color:#9F000F\"> Anaconda </span></mark> Python Distribution.  There are two ways to start on Windows:\n",
    " \n",
    " 1. Get the <mark><span style = \"color:#9F000F\"> Anaconda Navigator</span></mark> ap from the appstore and follow the installation instructions.\n",
    " 2. Download the [Anaconda Installer](http://anaconda.com/downloads) directly. Follow the installation instructions for Windowns available on the Windows download page. \n",
    " \n",
    "Once you have things downloaded, check that things are working right by using command prompt language. <mark><span style = \"color:#9F000F\"> 'Right click' </span></mark> on the <mark><span style = \"color:#9F000F\">Start menu</span></mark> and select <mark><span style = \"color:#9F000F\"> Command Prompt</span></mark> or <mark><span style = \"color:#9F000F\"> Anaconda Prompt</span></mark>. Start the Python interpreter by typing: <span style=\"background-color: Black\"><span style = \"color: White\"> **>    Python**</span></span>. You should see a message that matches the version of Anaconda installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"background-color: black; color:White ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid white;\">\n",
    "c:\\Users\\jstein=python \n",

    "</div> \n",
    "\n",
    "To leave the Python shell, press <mark><span style = \"color:#9F000F\"> Ctrl+D </span></mark> or type the command <span style=\"background-color: Black\"><span style = \"color: White\"> > **exit ()**  </span></span>\n",

    "> <span style=\"background-color: Black\"><span style = \"color: White\"> conda info --all </span></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "It should print out a notification on the version and type of Anaconda installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <span style=\"color:#786D5F\"> 2. Set up a virtual environment </span>\n",
    "Before we get started making changes to our new tools, we should set up a virtual environment using <mark><span style = \"color:#9F000F\">VirtualEnv</span></mark>. A virtual enviroment is an isolated python environement where you can protect your source code from Python library/package dependancy conflicts. This environment contains a fresh copy of the Python binary with its own copy of the Python standard library. Read more about it [here](https://pythontips.com/2013/07/30/what-is-virtualenv/).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this step, let's create a virtual environment called  <mark><span style = \"color:#9F000F\">pelicanTemp</span></mark>. Open up the Anaconda terminal from the Start menu and type the following:\n",
